# Speaker Notes — The Anatomy of a Good Point

## Overview
This session is about one skill: making a clear, compelling argument. We'll learn a 4-part framework you can use in any setting — meetings, presentations, emails, Slack messages. The examples use MNH, but the skill is universal.

## Slide: Why Does This Matter?

Have you ever made a point in a meeting that just... fell flat? You said something you knew was right, but nobody reacted. Or worse — you watched someone who was less informed, less prepared, walk into the room and win everyone over.

*(pause)*

We've all been there. And the frustrating thing is, it's usually not about what you know. Most of you in this room know your stuff. The gap is in how you deliver it. That's what today is about — closing that gap.

## Slide: The 4-Part Framework

So here's the framework. Four parts, and they all orbit around one thing in the center: your point.

Start in the middle — Step 1, "What's the point?" That's the nucleus. Everything else supports it.

Then Step 2, over here on the left — "Why it's true." That's your reasoning, your logical backbone.

Step 3 is actually two moves. Down here, 3a — Zoom In. That's where you take one specific example and make it vivid. Up here, 3b — Zoom Out. That's where you show it's not a one-off, it's a pattern.

And finally Step 4, on the right — "Who cares?" That's the impact. That's what makes people act, not just nod.

Take a moment to absorb this visual. We're going to walk through each step now, and we'll come back to this diagram at the end.

## Slide: Step 1 — Section Divider

Let's start with Step 1.

## Slide: What's the Point?

The single most common mistake in professional communication is burying the lead. You build up context, you give background, you hedge — and by the time you get to your actual point, half the room has checked out.

Here's the rule: lead with the conclusion, not the backstory. One sentence. Crisp. Direct. Your audience should know exactly what you're arguing within the first five seconds.

Now look at these two examples. On the left — "So I was looking at the neonatal mortality data, and there are some interesting patterns in Malawi, and if we compare the staffing ratios with other countries..." That's how most of us actually talk in meetings. It's a warm-up. It's throat-clearing. And it loses people.

On the right — "We need to recruit 200 additional nurse-midwives in Malawi's high-burden facilities by year-end." One sentence. You know exactly what this person wants. You can agree, disagree, or ask questions — but you're not confused.

Which version would you rather hear at minute 45 of a long meeting?

## Slide: The "Headline Test"

Here's a quick test you can apply to any point you're about to make. Ask yourself: if this were a newspaper headline, would it make sense on its own?

Look at the left column. "There are some staffing challenges." That's not a headline — that's a placeholder. It doesn't tell you what's actually going on.

Now the right column. "Malawi has a 65% vacancy rate for nurse-midwife technicians." That's a headline. You read it and you immediately understand the problem.

Same with the next row. "We should think about the product rollout" versus "We need to deploy the PPH bundle across all 120 target facilities this quarter." Night and day.

The pattern is always the same: the vague version avoids committing to a specific claim. The strong version puts a stake in the ground.

Here's a challenge for you — think about the last point you made in a real meeting. Would it pass the headline test?

## Slide: Step 2 — Section Divider

Okay, Step 2.

## Slide: Why It's True

Once you've stated your point, the next thing people need is the reasoning. The "because." This is the logical backbone — not a story, not a statistic, just the chain of logic that connects your claim to reality.

Here's how it works. The point was: "We need to recruit 200 additional nurse-midwives in Malawi's high-burden facilities." Okay, why?

"Because Malawi has only 22 obstetricians and 1 neonatologist for 679,000 annual births. The vacancy rate for nurse-midwife technicians is 65%. You simply cannot deliver quality emergency obstetric care with these numbers."

Notice what that reasoning does. It doesn't cite a study. It doesn't tell a story. It lays out a logical argument: here are the numbers, here's why they're insufficient, here's the conclusion. That's the "because."

A lot of people skip this step — they jump straight from their point to an example or a data chart. But without the reasoning, the audience doesn't know *why* your point follows from your evidence. You need the connective tissue.

## Slide: Strong vs. Weak Reasoning

Now, not all reasoning is created equal. Look at the left column: "I feel like we need more staff." "Other organizations are doing it." "It's the standard recommendation."

These all *sound* reasonable in the moment. But notice what they have in common — they don't actually explain why something is true. They rely on feelings, convention, or what other people are doing.

Now the right column: "The vacancy rate is 65%." "A 10% coverage increase averts 22% of maternal deaths." "WHO and Lancet data both confirm this." These rely on evidence and logic. They give your audience something they can evaluate.

Here's the thing to watch for in yourself: weak reasoning is comfortable. It feels like you've justified your point. But if someone pushes back, it crumbles. Strong reasoning holds up under scrutiny.

## Slide: Step 3 — Section Divider

Now Step 3, which is the meatiest part — evidence. And we split it into two moves: Zoom In and Zoom Out.

## Slide: Zoom In (Deduction)

Zooming in means picking one specific, concrete case and telling its story. You're going from the general claim down to a specific example that proves it.

Here's what that sounds like: "In one district hospital in Malawi, there were zero trained neonatal nurses covering a unit with 30 admissions per day. When a partner program placed just 4 mentored nurse-midwives there last year, the facility's neonatal mortality dropped by 35% in six months. That's what even a modest staffing increase looks like in practice."

Feel the difference? Numbers and logic appeal to the head. A specific story like this appeals to the gut. People remember the hospital with zero nurses and 30 babies a day. They remember the 35% drop. That's what Zoom In does — it makes the abstract tangible.

## Slide: Zoom Out (Induction)

Zooming out is the opposite move. You step back and show that your point isn't just one hospital having a good run — it's a pattern.

"This isn't just one hospital. The Lancet's modelling shows that a modest 10% increase in midwifery coverage every five years could avert 22% of maternal deaths, 23% of newborn deaths, and 14% of stillbirths globally — saving 1.35 million lives by 2035. With quality midwifery care, mothers are 24% less likely to experience preterm birth."

That's global, peer-reviewed, quantified. It tells the audience: this works everywhere, not just in that one district hospital.

So Zoom In makes you *feel* the point. Zoom Out makes you *believe* the point. You need both.

## Slide: Why You Need Both

And here's why. If you only Zoom In — "One hospital saw a 35% drop" — someone in the room is going to think: "Is that a fluke? Maybe that hospital was an outlier."

If you only Zoom Out — "The Lancet model projects..." — someone else is going to think: "Sure, globally. But does that apply to our specific context?"

When you use both together, they cover each other's weaknesses. The specific case makes the global data concrete. The global data makes the specific case representative.

So remember: Zoom In makes it real. Zoom Out makes it credible. Use both to build an airtight case.

Quick question for the room — which do you personally default to? Are you a "tell a story" person or a "cite the data" person? Most of us lean one way. Knowing your tendency helps you remember to balance it.

## Slide: Step 4 — Section Divider

And now the step that most people forget entirely — Step 4.

## Slide: Who Cares? The Impact

Every audience is silently asking one question the entire time you're talking: "So what? Why should I care?"

If you don't answer that question, they'll answer it themselves — and the answer is usually "I don't."

Step 4 is where you connect your argument to what matters to *them*. You quantify the upside — or the cost of inaction. You make it feel urgent and relevant. This is what turns a good argument into a call to action.

Without Step 4, you've made an intellectually sound case. With Step 4, you've given people a reason to actually do something.

## Slide: Making Them Care

Here's what Step 4 sounds like: "If we fill these 200 nurse-midwife positions, our models estimate we can prevent over 3,000 maternal and newborn deaths per year in Malawi alone. If we don't act, those positions stay vacant and those deaths remain preventable but unprevented. Every month of delay costs lives we have the tools to save."

"Preventable but unprevented." Let that phrase sit for a second. That's the kind of language that moves people to action.

Now here's an important nuance. The "who cares" needs to be tailored to who's actually in the room. A government minister cares about national health indicators. A donor cares about lives saved per dollar. A facility director cares about staff workload and patient outcomes. Same argument, different framing of the impact. Knowing your audience is what separates a competent presenter from a persuasive one.

## Slide: Putting It All Together — Section Divider

Alright, let's put all four steps together and hear what the complete argument sounds like.

## Slide: Full Example

I'm going to read this straight through, as if I were standing up in a meeting making this case. Listen for the four parts.

"We need to recruit 200 additional nurse-midwives in Malawi's high-burden facilities by year-end."

"Malawi has 1 neonatologist and a 65% nurse-midwife vacancy rate for 679,000 annual births. Quality care is impossible at these levels."

"One district hospital placed 4 mentored nurse-midwives and saw neonatal mortality drop 35% in six months."

"The Lancet shows a 10% increase in midwifery coverage averts 22% of maternal deaths and 23% of newborn deaths — 1.35 million lives saved by 2035."

"Filling these positions prevents over 3,000 deaths per year in Malawi. Every month of delay costs lives we have the tools to save."

*(pause)*

That whole argument takes maybe 30 seconds to deliver. It's not long. But it's *complete*. Point, reasoning, evidence in both directions, impact. Would that convince you? What would you push back on?

## Slide: Common Mistakes

Let's talk about what goes wrong. Five common mistakes, and I'd bet everyone in this room has a favorite.

"Burying the point." You save the big reveal for the end. That works in movies. It doesn't work in meetings.

"Skipping the why." You make an assertion but never explain the logic behind it. People might agree in the moment, but they won't fight for your idea when you leave the room.

"Only one type of evidence." One anecdote, or one statistic, but not both. As we just saw, you need Zoom In *and* Zoom Out.

"Forgetting the so what." You lay out a perfect case and then just... stop. If you don't spell out the impact, your audience won't do it for you.

"Going in the wrong order." You lead with the evidence and build up to the point. Flip it. Point first, always.

Which of these do you recognize in yourself? No shame — these are universal habits. The framework gives you a checklist to catch them.

## Slide: Adapt the Framework

Now, I don't want you walking out of here thinking you need to run through all four steps every time you open your mouth. That would be exhausting, and your colleagues would hate you.

The framework is flexible. Look at this table. If you're making a quick comment in a meeting, Steps 1 and 2 are usually enough — state the point, give the reason. Done.

Writing an email? Steps 1 and 4 — the point and the impact. People will ask for evidence if they want it.

Trying to persuade a skeptic? Go heavy on Steps 2, 3a, and 3b — stack the reasoning and evidence.

Writing an executive summary? Steps 1 and 4. Executives want the conclusion and the stakes. They'll drill down if they need to.

The meta-lesson here: frameworks are tools, not scripts. Use what you need for the situation.

## Slide: Key Takeaways

Four things to take away from today.

One — lead with the point. Don't make people guess what you're arguing.

Two — back it up with reasoning. Give them the "because."

Three — Zoom In and Zoom Out. Make it real with a specific case, and make it credible with the bigger pattern.

Four — land the impact. Answer "who cares?" before they have to ask.

And the one line I want you to remember: a good point isn't just correct — it's complete. Point, reasoning, evidence, impact. That's the checklist.

## Slide: Closing

Now go make better points.

*(pause)*

And if you want to put this to use right now — think about a point you need to make this week in your real work. A recommendation, a request, an argument for a decision. Take 60 seconds and run it through the four steps in your head. Point. Why it's true. Zoom In. Zoom Out. Who cares. If you can do that before your next meeting, this session has already paid for itself.
